# Program to read in weights and generate counts for three categories
# Erroneous data are picked out and not counted

# Open the file
# Read the file line by line
# Split the line into strings based on ","
# For each component string
#    Convert it to float
#    If conversion fails, it's erroneous input
#    Else place it in its category and increase the category count by 1
#
# Print the results
