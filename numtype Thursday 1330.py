# Program to read numbers from a file and count number of ints and floats
# also need to count non-numbers.
# The algorithm relies on converting individual strings to numbers and check
# for failure. Convert to int first, if success, then it is an int. Else
# try float, if success, then it is a float. Else it must be error.
# Algorithm:
# Open the file
# Read the file line by line
# Split the line into strings based on " "
# For each component string
#    Convert it to integer
#    If successful, increase integer count by 1
#    Else convert it to float
#       If successful, increase float count by 1
#       Else increase error count by 1
#
# Print the results
